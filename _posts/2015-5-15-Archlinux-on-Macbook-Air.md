title: Archlinux on Macbook Air
---

I recently bought a Macbook Air 13" (2014 model). It is an amazing machine. Apple has done very well with this little laptop/ultrabook/netbook/whatever.

## Pros

* Light and very small
* 12+ hours battery life
* Great build quality

## Cons

* Mac OS is very restrictive
* No delete key, no home key, strange position of fn key
* Keyboard is not symmetric

Archlinux seemed like the best choice of Linux to put onto the Macbook. Here is the process I follwed.

# Create Bootable Flash Drive

# Partition

# Install Archlinux

# EFI Bootloader

# Desktop Setup

# Mac Fixes

# Power Efficiency
