Schools seem to be very caught up on apps. Many teachers of the opinion that kids should have devices in class so that they can use the \*insert app name\* app in their classroom. While there are certainly some good educational apps out there, I don't think that they're the reason to jump on the [BYOD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device) bandwagon.
